- You will not add preamble to your response.

- You will not add comments to code.

- You will not elaborate on the code in prose, you will only reply in code.

Please convert recipe below into markdown format.

Convert each ingredient to a task and add markdown links to each item.
Example details are below.

So when you see this for example:
"½ cup dried cranberries"

please rewrite it as as a markdown task like this:
- [x] ½ cup [[dried cranberries]]

Where [x] represents a completed task and [[ ]] is the Obsidian
flavored markdown syntax to represent a hyperlink.



# Instructions for Converting and Formatting Recipe Measurements

1. Convert the given metric measurements to US customary volume units where possible.
   - Prefer conversions to cups, tablespoons (tbsp), or teaspoons (tsp).
   - For dry ingredients, use volume equivalents (e.g., 1 cup of flour ≈ 120-125g).
   - Keep weight units (oz, lb) only when volume conversion isn't practical.

2. Format each ingredient on a single line:
   - Maintain the original checkbox format if present.
   - Start with the metric measurement.
   - Follow with the US measurement in parentheses.
   - Include any additional descriptors (e.g., "can", "dry or drained").

3. Use forward slashes (/) to separate metric and US measurements.

4. Keep all other information from the original list intact.

## Examples

Original:
- [x] 100 g (1 can) chickpeas, dry or drained
- [x] 224 g (1/2 lb) orzo

Converted and formatted:
- [x] 100 g / 1/2 cup (1 can) chickpeas, dry or drained
- [x] 224 g / 1 cup (1/2 lb) orzo

Another example:
Original:
- [ ] 500 ml heavy cream
- [ ] 50 g unsalted butter

Converted and formatted:
- [ ] 500 ml / 2 cups heavy cream
- [ ] 50 g / 3.5 tbsp unsalted butter





Please make the following transformation: If the ingredient you see in
the recipe semantically matches one of the below pre-existing
ingredients, then wrap the ingredient its pre-existing alias.

So, for example, when you see this:
- 6 fresh thyme sprigs
- [x] 100 g (1 can) chickpeas, dry or drained
- [x] 224 g (1/2 lb) orzo

then please rewrite it as as a markdown task like this:
- [x] 6 fresh [[fresh thyme leaves]]
- [x] 100 g (1 can) [[Garbonzo beans]], dry or drained
- [x] 224 g (1/2 lb) [[orzo pasta]]

assuming you found fresh thyme leaves in our pre-existing ingredients list (below) and fresh
thyme sprigs is symantically very similar--if not the same--as fresh
thyme leaves

Please apply the same logic for exam if you find chickpeas or orzo
- similarly for chickpeas and Garbonzo beans
- orzo is the ingredient which is in fact orzo pasta

These are just examples of course.


If the ingredient doesn't yet exist in our pre-existing list then
still you should wrap the ingredient in a link like this: [[dried
cranberries]].

Please report your ingredient conversions in new header named
"Conversions" and put the conversions section last.

For example if the pre-existing ingredient is kosher salt and the
recipe calls for 1 tablespoon salt, then you should report this
conversion.

Please report it with a notice saying "I've made thes conversions
based off the ingredients I've found in your pre-existing list" and
then list them similar to this as a bulleted list:

- salt -> [[kosher salt]]
- toasted sesame seeds -> [[sesame seeds]]

You should only report conversions if in fact they are conversions.
For example if you find "Kosher salt" in the recipe, then you don't
need to report that you're making a conversion from salt to kosher
salt since kosher salt was in the original.

Notice how I've added double brackets around the target conversion
kosher salt. The reason for this is this is the link format Obsidian
recognizes for internal links.

Often times you'll see Nutrition section. Please remove it from your
output. Its not helfpul.

You should include the recipe instructions as well as the ingredients.

When you write instructions for the recipe, it is helpful if you split
the items in each step by bulleted list.

For example if I give you instructions like this:

<instruction_step>
Meanwhile, over medium heat, add onions, oil, remaining butter, salt & pepper to pan. Stir, cook on medium low heat for 5 min.
</instruction_step>

You should reformat the step like this:

<instruction_step>
Meanwhile, over medium heat, add

- onions
- oil
- remaining butter
- salt
- pepper

to pan. Stir, cook on medium low heat for 5 min.
</instruction_step>

Each sentence should be a new paragraph.

Instructions are often listed in an ordered list, but we don't want an
ordered list. Instead we want to keep the indent as flat as possible.

So, you've gathered the comma separated list of items in a particular step and made
it very easy to ready by reformatting the list of items into a bulleted list.

Please convert the content in the recipe xml element below.

Please reply in a single code block.

Each sentence should be a new paragraph.
